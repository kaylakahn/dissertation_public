This repo contains some cleaned scripts from my dissertation and some slides. I'm working on readying (cleaning, redacting, etc.) some of the others scripts to make public. Data are not currently publicly available. My dissertation articles can be read [here](https://kaylakahn.github.io/research/) under working papers and [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5233998).
